# Kinematics_Mask
Very simple kinematics model about using/not a  mask and social distancing.

1) I tried to make a very simple kinematics model about sneezing. In the case of without mask, I use very simple projectile motion 
2) With Mas, I use simple projectile motion and inelastic collision with 'mask'.

There are so many simplifications in this model. However, the maximum distance of the ejected droplet without mask is 2.6 m if the high of
mouth is 1.6 m.
