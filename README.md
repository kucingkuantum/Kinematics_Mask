# Kinematics of droplet during the sneezing using/not a mask.
Recently, there is hot debate wether wehave to use mask or not during the covid-19 pandemic. 

I tried to make a very simple kinematics model about sneezing. 

1) In the case of without mask, I use very simple projectile motion 
2) With Mas, I use simple projectile motion and inelastic collision with 'mask'.

There are so many simplifications in this model. However, the maximum distance of the ejected droplet without mask is 2.6 m if the high of
mouth is 1.6 m.
